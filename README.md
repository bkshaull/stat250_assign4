To open the interactive map of China:
1. Open the provided R code, and change the working directory to wherever
the chinamaphtml.html, SVG file and other PNG files are being stored. 
2. Run the R code to generate the PNG files for each time series graph.
3. Open the chinamaphtml.html in Safari (For some reason won't work in 
Google chrome not sure about Firefox)

This creates an interactive map of China.  When the user clicks on a 
numbered province, a time series of minimum prices for that province
pops up.
